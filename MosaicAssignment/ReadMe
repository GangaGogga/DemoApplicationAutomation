The solution contains automation of following functionalities
 1. Login
 2. Logout
 3. Currency table fetching results from api 
 
Automation of the demo application is done based on PageObject Framework where all the web elements 
of each webpage are located in each of the java class grouped under "pages" package. Tests are then written on each of the test 
classes grouped under "tests" package. WebDriverFactory class is written to open the browser for each test within "utilities"
package.

The following libraries were added and used to the project
   1. org.json.simple - to use JSONObject
   2. gson - to convert JSONObject to Map
   3. TestNG - To have assertions in the tests and produce the tests in report format
   
The solution currently contains 12 tests, where 4 of them are failing currently.
